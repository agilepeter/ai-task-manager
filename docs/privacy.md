# Privacy

Pane is built on one rule: **your data is nobody's business, including
ours.** There is no Pane account, and no Pane backend receives your quotas,
spend, keys, or provider data. The Pane-hosted update endpoint and the
minimal, anonymous daily statistic are described in full below.

## Every network call Pane can make

This is the complete list. Anything not listed here does not happen.

| Destination | When | What is sent |
|---|---|---|
| Each provider's own API (Anthropic, OpenAI/ChatGPT, cursor.com, GitHub, x.ai, opencode.ai, Devin, MiniMax, OpenRouter, Z.ai, Google, DeepSeek, Moonshot, Kimi Code, ElevenLabs, Codebuff, Kilo, AihubMix, Alibaba Model Studio…) | Every refresh (default 1 min), only for providers you have enabled | That provider's own token/key, exactly as its official tool would send it. Full per-provider detail: [providers.md](providers.md) |
| User-configured One/New API origins | Status probe when saving/changing a site, plus one unauthenticated backfill if a stored site has no display unit; billing on every refresh for enabled keys | `/api/status` with no key. Subscription + usage send that site's key as Bearer, **only to that origin** — never to Pane servers. |
| User-configured Sub2API origins | Each enabled key's scheduled refresh; saving only validates local input | `GET /v1/usage` with that key as Bearer, only to its configured origin, without redirects or fallback endpoints. |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` (LiteLLM), `models.dev`, `robinebers.github.io` | ~Daily | Anonymous GET for public model price tables (no identifying data) |
| `trypane.xyz/api/update` (the legacy `pane.jazii.dev/api/update` redirects there; GitHub Releases is the final fallback) | On launch, whenever the popover opens, and every 4 h in the background | Anonymous GET for the update manifest, carrying the app version. See "The update check" below for exactly what this counts. |
| `us.i.posthog.com` | Once per day | The two anonymous daily-statistic events described in "Anonymous usage statistics" below — a random ID, version, enabled-provider list, and per-provider success/failure counts. Never usage amounts, spend, keys, or error text. |
| `127.0.0.1:11434` (your own PC) | Every refresh, if Ollama is enabled | Local-only query of your Ollama server |

Notably absent: session recording, event streams, A/B flags, autocapture
of any kind — none of it exists in the codebase, and the daily statistic
above is the entire analytics surface.

## Anonymous usage statistics

This statistic is **always on — there is no in-app switch.** Pane sends
at most two kinds of event per day to PostHog (the same disclosed
approach as the Mac app Pane is a port of):

- **`app_daily_active`** — once per day: "this install was alive today",
  the app version, which providers are enabled, which metrics you
  starred (stable IDs only), appearance/density/refresh settings.
  Multi-account installs report only the plain provider family
  ("claude", once) — account-scoped card ids are derived from your
  account identity and never leave the machine, on any field of either
  event.
- **`provider_refresh_daily`** — per provider, summarizing the previous
  day: how many refreshes succeeded, went stale, or failed, with failure
  *categories* only (auth / rate-limit / server / network / other).
  The raw error text never leaves your machine — it can contain paths
  or account details, so only the category enum is sent.
  One/New API (`onenewapi`) is reported as that family id at most once
  per refresh. Site ids, key ids, configured counts, labels, and origins
  never leave the machine.

The identity attached to these events is a **random UUID** generated on
your machine — derived from nothing (not your hardware, not your IP, not
your account), linked to nothing, stored in `%APPDATA%\Pane\telemetry.json`.
Every event also instructs PostHog not to build a person profile, and the
PostHog project is configured to **discard client IP addresses** at
ingestion (country-level GeoIP resolves first, then the IP is dropped).

What is *never* sent: your quotas, usage
percentages, spend amounts, model names from your logs, tokens, keys,
file paths, or any free-form text. The entire implementation is one
auditable file: [`src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs`](../src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs)
— no SDK, just two documented POSTs.

## The update check

Pane has to ask *somewhere* "is there a newer version?" — that request
existed from day one. It runs at launch, whenever you open the
popover, and every 4 h in the background if the popover never opens. New builds ask `trypane.xyz` first and use GitHub as
the automatic fallback. Old builds that still call `pane.jazii.dev` are
handled by a permanent redirect to `trypane.xyz`. Every endpoint serves
the same manifest, and every update is still signature-verified against
the key baked into the app. The server counts, per day: **how many
distinct installs checked in, from which country, on which version.** That's
the entire list. Concretely:

- **No IP addresses are stored.** Uniqueness comes from a salted one-way
  hash folded into a [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog)
  — a counter that can say "≈37 distinct installs today" but is
  mathematically incapable of listing them.
- **Country** is the two-letter code the CDN edge derives; nothing
  finer (no city, no region, no coordinates).
- **Version** is the `?v=` parameter the updater sends.
- Nothing else: no machine ids, no usernames, no usage data — your
  quotas, spend, and provider data never leave your PC, same as always.

The counting code is public in the site repo, and the request itself is
identical either way — the only thing that changed is who serves the
manifest first.

## What stays on your PC

Sub2API is excluded from anonymous statistics, including family-level
refresh counts, enabled-provider counts and starred metrics. Site names,
addresses, key labels/identities/counts, balances, quotas, spend and raw
error text are not collected. Its manually pasted keys are stored in the
independent `%APPDATA%\Pane\sub2api.json` document with atomic replacement
and owner-only permissions. Settings never returns saved keys or fragments.
Keys are sent only to their configured origin's `GET /v1/usage`, with
redirects disabled and no fallback endpoints. Its local HTTP entries expose
safe display information and error/stale state, omitting credentials,
origins, dashboard URLs and raw responses. See [providers.md](providers.md).

- **Credentials**: read from the files the official CLIs already maintain
  (see [providers.md](providers.md)); pasted API keys live in
  `%APPDATA%\Pane\<provider>.json`. One/New API sites and keys use a
  nested `%APPDATA%\Pane\onenewapi.json`, written owner-only (Windows
  protected DACL / Unix `0600`) so a permissive Pane directory cannot
  expose the secrets; Settings lists names, URLs, and
  key labels only — never secrets or fragments. Sent only to their own
  vendor (or the user-configured One/New API origin). Status fingerprint
  (`GET /api/status`, no key) is structural only; billing is
  `/v1/dashboard/billing/subscription` and `/usage` (cents → dollars;
  sentinel `100000000` = unlimited). Some panels return the same
  user-level quota for every key; OneAPI with
  `DisplayTokenStatEnabled=false` can be account-level or inaccurate —
  Pane does not call native token usage/log APIs to compensate. AihubMix
  stays a separate built-in provider; One/New API values are not folded
  into Total Spend. `https://` is allowed for any valid host; `http://` is
  limited to private, loopback, or link-local IPv4/IPv6 address literals.
- **Refreshed OAuth tokens**: written back to the CLIs' own credential
  files so your tools stay signed in — same behavior as the CLIs
  themselves.
- **Usage snapshots & spend cache**: `%APPDATA%\Pane\` — cached locally so
  the app opens instantly; never uploaded.
- **Spend accounting**: computed by reading the CLIs' local log files on
  your disk. The logs never leave your machine; only the public price
  tables are downloaded.

## The local HTTP API

`http://127.0.0.1:6736/v1/usage` exists so your own scripts and widgets
can read your usage. It is loopback-only (nothing on your network can
reach it), serves usage numbers only (never credentials or keys), and
sends **no CORS headers**, and refuses non-loopback `Host` headers — so
websites you visit cannot read it through your browser, not even via
DNS rebinding. One/New API key cards are addressable by full snapshot
id (`onenewapi@<key-id>`) and omit dashboard URL, origin, and secrets.
Details: [local-http-api.md](local-http-api.md).

## Verifying all of this

Pane is MIT-licensed and this repository is the entire codebase. Search
it: there is no analytics SDK import, and every `http` call site lives
in a provider module ([`src-tauri/src/providers/`](../src-tauri/src/providers/)),
the pricing engine ([`src-tauri/src/pricing.rs`](../src-tauri/src/pricing.rs)),
the updater registration ([`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs)),
or the one-file statistics module ([`src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs`](../src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs)).
